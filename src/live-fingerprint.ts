/**
 * Live fingerprint extraction.
 *
 * At dario startup, spawn the user's actual `claude` binary against a
 * loopback MITM endpoint, capture the outbound /v1/messages request, and
 * use the captured system prompt / tools / agent identity as the template
 * replay source — instead of shipping a stale snapshot in
 * `cc-template-data.json`.
 *
 * The bundled snapshot remains as a fallback for users without CC installed
 * or when live capture fails. Template replay auto-heals on CC updates
 * without any user action.
 *
 * Security: the MITM endpoint only accepts connections from 127.0.0.1 and
 * only runs long enough to capture a single request. CC's OAuth token
 * never leaves the machine — we send CC to a loopback URL that CC itself
 * trusts because we set ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL in the child's environment.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "Hide in the population" roadmap (v3.13 → ?)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The fingerprint pipeline has historically cared about one axis: what
 * goes INSIDE the /v1/messages body (agent identity, system prompt, tool
 * list). That's only one fingerprint vector. Anthropic can (and likely
 * does) look at several others:
 *
 *   1. Header ORDER. Node's http module emits headers in alphabetical
 *      order via setHeader(). Undici preserves insertion order. Real CC
 *      uses undici with a specific insertion pattern. If dario sends
 *      headers in a different order than CC, the difference is trivially
 *      observable on the server side via the raw header array.
 *      → Captured as `header_order` below. Outbound proxy paths should
 *        use the captured order when rebuilding fetch() headers.
 *
 *   2. TLS ClientHello (JA3 / JA4 fingerprint). The cipher list, elliptic
 *      curves, extension order, and ALPN negotiation are determined by
 *      the TLS library, and Node's TLS (OpenSSL) produces a distinctive
 *      fingerprint that differs from any browser or from curl. Real CC
 *      running on top of Node has the Node JA3 — so we already match,
 *      provided both run on the same Node major. A cross-runtime worry
 *      surfaces when Anthropic ships Bun- or bundled-binary CC: at that
 *      point Node-dario and Bun-CC would JA-differ.
 *      → Mitigation: dario auto-relaunches under Bun when it's on PATH so
 *        the proxy's ClientHello matches CC's Bun/BoringSSL shape;
 *        `--strict-tls` refuses to start otherwise.
 *
 *   3. HTTP/2 frame ordering + SETTINGS parameters. Similar to TLS, this
 *      is controlled by the HTTP library. Node and undici produce a
 *      consistent H2 fingerprint. Matches as long as both ends run the
 *      same library.
 *
 *   4. Request timing distribution. Real CC sends requests with jitter
 *      driven by user typing, tool-call sequencing, and internal retry
 *      logic. Dario-through-a-client sends requests with jitter driven
 *      by WHATEVER client is on the other end (OpenClaw, Hermes, curl).
 *      That distribution differs from CC's. Anthropic could pattern-match
 *      "no inter-request jitter" as a fingerprint for automated usage.
 *      → Deferred. Adds latency for debatable gain. Analytics already
 *        tracks per-request timing — could drive a replay distribution
 *        later.
 *
 *   5. sessionId rotation cadence. CC rotates its internal session id
 *      on a specific cadence (observed: roughly once per conversation
 *      start, not per-request). Dario today uses a static session id
 *      from loadClaudeIdentity. A proxy that kept rotating sessionId
 *      randomly would stand out; a proxy that never rotates also stands
 *      out. Matching CC's cadence requires observing CC over a longer
 *      period than a single capture session.
 *      → Deferred. Requires a longer-running capture mode.
 *
 *   6. Request body field ordering. JSON is unordered, but the wire
 *      serialization IS ordered. Real CC uses a specific field order
 *      for /v1/messages (e.g., `model` before `messages` before
 *      `system` before `tools`). A proxy that serializes in a different
 *      order leaks its origin.
 *      → Worth matching. Cheap to implement — the template capture
 *        already produces a body we can walk to recover field order.
 *        Deferred to a follow-up.
 *
 * The concrete v3.13 move is (1): capture header_order and make it
 * available on the template so the outbound proxy paths can reproduce
 * it. Everything else is documented here as a roadmap so the next
 * contributor — or dario maintainer six months from now — can pick up
 * the right piece without re-deriving the threat model.
